# Hangman API
An API built on Express.js (Node.js) to service the [hangman paper and pencil guessing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)).

## Goals
The primary goal is exploration and refreshing myself on technologies I haven't used in 2 or 3 years.
* Explore AWS' Elastic Container Service (ECS) - I'm comfortable with kubernetes deployment pipelines but was curious about AWS container service. This is deployed and maintained on ECS.
* Compare and explore Express.js from when I first worked with it in 2014 (at least a major version or two ago). The main questions were around simplified API and scalability.
* Explore D3.js - I've managed multiple developers as they've learned D3 for projects on our team. It can produce fantastic results but I've noticed a significant learning curve. I wanted to see for myself
* Have an API/UI to play hangman on.
